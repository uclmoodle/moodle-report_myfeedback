  @javascript
  Scenario: Module tutors need to be able to view grades of students taking courses they are recorded as a tutor for
    When I log in as "tutor1"
    And I navigate to the My feedback plugin page
    Then I should see a tab named "Module tutor dashboard"
    And I should see a tab named "My students"
    When I click the tab titled "My students"
    And I search for tutees using "%"
    Then I should see the following students listed:
      | username | email                | fullname    |
      | student1 | student1@example.com | Student One |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Personal tutors need to be able to view grades of their tutees. For instance, when a Personal Tutor is
  preparing for a meeting with a student during which the tutor wishes to discuss the student's performance
  (perhaps focusing on areas where they are doing well and where there is room for improvement.)
    When I log in as "tutor3"
    And I navigate to the My feedback plugin page
    Then I should see a tab named "Module tutor dashboard"
    And I should see a tab named "My students"
    When I click the tab titled "My students"
    And I search for tutees using "%"
    Then I should see the following students listed:
      | username | email                | fullname      |
      | student1 | student1@example.com | Student One   |
      | student3 | student3@example.com | Student Three |

  @javascript
  Scenario: A Departmental Admin wishes to log-in and check student performance across a cohort so that they can identify
  any potential students struggling (and subsequently raise these instances of concerning performance with module Tutors.)
    When I log in as "deptadmin"
    And I navigate to the My feedback plugin page
    Then I should see a tab named "Departmental admin dashboard"
