 * @author    Jessica Gramp <j.gramp@ucl.ac.uk> or <jgramp@gmail.com>
 * @author    Delvon Forrester <delvon@esparanza.co.uk>
 *  credits   Based on original work report_mygrades by David Bezemer <david.bezemer@uplearning.nl> which
 *            in turn is based on block_myfeedback by Karen Holland, Mei Jin, Jiajia Chen.
 *            Also uses SQL originating from Richard Havinga <richard.havinga@ulcc.ac.uk>.
 *            The code for using an external database is taken from Juan leyva's
 *            <http://www.twitter.com/jleyvadelgado> configurable reports block.
 *            The idea for this reporting tool originated with Dr Jason Davies <j.p.davies@ucl.ac.uk> and
 *            Prof John Mitchell <j.mitchell@ucl.ac.uk>
 *            The tool is also based on outputs from a Jisc project on
 *            'Assessment Careers: enhancing learning pathways through assessment'
 *            directed by Dr Gwyneth Hughes with input from Tim Neumann who collaborated with UCL for this plugin.
